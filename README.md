# WJLSymmetricEncryption
WJLSymmetricEncryption is a symmetric encryption algorithm source program based on a weighted probability model, which has:
1, is based on the wheel function of the weight coefficient and, yes, the information entropy of the original data does not change.
2, supports custom secret key length, combined with WJLHA3.
3, employs random numbers (the length that can be defined), making the results different for each coding.
